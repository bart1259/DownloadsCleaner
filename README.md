# Downloads Cleaner

Downloads cleaner is a windows C# application that cleans, by default, the downloads directory but can be configured to clean whatever directory is needed.

## How do I run the application?

Set the DownloadsCleanerStartup.exe in the CleanInstallationFiles folder to run on startup. When the application is run, an icon will appear in the taskbar that can be used to configure the application.
