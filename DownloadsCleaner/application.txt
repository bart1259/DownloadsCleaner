Deletion Strategies:
1. None: The user is not notified of the deletion of the files
2. Notify: The user is notified of the deletion of the files and can cancel.
	If the deletion is canceled, the file is put on a do not delete list
3. Confirm: The user must confirm that they want the file to be deleted.
	If no action is done or if no is pressed, the files are put on the do not delete list
